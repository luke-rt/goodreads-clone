"Read" button - You can add books to your read list
Profiles - Once you make an account, you can save a list of the books you have read that connects with your account

3. How much time you spent developing this project
6hrs, and I spent a lot less time styling than I normally do with websites due to the amount of homework I had that week, which is one area which I would improve if I worked with Penn Spark
